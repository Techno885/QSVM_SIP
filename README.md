# QSVM_SIP
Research Project into the comparison of QSVM and SVM classification.

This project comapares the capibilites of machine learning on traditional computing systems and on quantum computing systems. 
More specifically the ability to solve classification problems.
To demostrate these capibilities the breast cancer classification dataset was trained on both a SVM model and a QSVM model.
Aqua 1 is the code used to train the SVM with 80% percent train and 20% test.
Aqua 2 is the code used to train the QSVM with a maxium training set of 20 and a test set of 10.
Aqua 3 is another SVM but with the training set of 20 to match the QSVM.
